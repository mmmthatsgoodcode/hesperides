hesperides-cassify-astyanax - Creates an Astyanax representation of the wide row, as Transformed from your Object by hesperides-transform
hesperides-cassify-hector - Creates a Hector representation of the wide row, as Transformed from your Object by hesperides-transform

hesperides-core - common code

hesperides-client - very minimal client for integration tests/examples and the console
hesperides-console - servlet to search/browse objects in Cassandra
hesperides-examples-thrift - a small app that persists and reads objects Objects to/from a Cassandra wide row, via Thrift
hesperides-examples-astyanax - a small app that persists and reads objects Objects to/from a Cassandra wide row, via Astyanax
hesperides-examples-hector - a small app that persists and reads objects Objects to/from a Cassandra wide row, via Hector
